    Choose a collection to work with.  If you have &quot;write&quot; access to
    a collection, you can add new objects or update existing objects.  Contact
    UC3 if you don't see the collection you need.  Whatever else we need to say.

    We really don't know what is happening with the profile service right
    now, so we're not sure how permissions or number of objects will ever
    get populated.

  <p>You can look up a known primary ID across all collections. Once you select
    a collection, you will be able to search by title, creator or local ID.
